📊 Teleprompter LLC – Trial Conversion Optimization
🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes user activity data from Teleprompter LLC, a company supporting online content creators with smooth video recording tools since 2018. With over 10,000 new users every month and a database exceeding 15 million records, the aim is to identify key factors influencing conversion from free trial to paid subscription — and ultimately, improve business performance.

🛠️ Methods Used
•	Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Logistic Regression Modeling (with custom thresholds)
•	Confusion Matrix Visualization
•	Conversion Segmentation (by OS, Country, Time)
•	Churn vs. Reactivation Analysis
________________________________________
🔍 Key Insights
•	Certain OS versions and countries show significantly higher conversion rates, suggesting technical or behavioral segmentation opportunities.
•	Trial users who return after cancelation remain a small segment — highlighting retention challenges.
•	Users on non-annual plans show higher churn than returning users, signaling a need for better long-term offers.
