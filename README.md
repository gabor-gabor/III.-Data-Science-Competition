# 📊 Teleprompter LLC – Trial Conversion Optimization

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project analyzes user activity data from **Teleprompter LLC**, a company supporting online content creators with smooth video recording tools since 2018. With over **10,000 new users every month** and a database exceeding **15 million records**, the aim is to identify **key factors influencing conversion from free trial to paid subscription** — and ultimately, improve business performance.

## 🎯 Business Objective  
**Goal:** Increase the conversion rate from `trial_started` → `converted`, turning more trial users into paying customers.  
**Impact:**  
- 💰 Higher recurring revenue  
- 📈 Increased customer lifetime value (CLV)  
- 🔁 Reduced churn rate

## 🛠️ Methods Used  
- 🔍 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🤖 Logistic Regression Modeling (with custom thresholds)  
- 📉 Confusion Matrix Visualization  
- 🌍 Conversion Segmentation (by OS, Country, Time)  
- 🔁 Churn vs. Reactivation Analysis

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- Certain **OS versions** and **countries** show significantly higher conversion rates, suggesting technical or behavioral segmentation opportunities.  
- Trial users who **return after cancelation** remain a small segment — highlighting retention challenges.  
- Users on **non-annual plans** show higher churn than returning users, signaling a need for better long-term offers.

## 📌 Tools & Libraries  
- 🐍 Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- 📊 Power BI (for dashboard) 
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook  
- 🔄 Git & GitHub for version control  
- 🖥️ PowerPoint (for presentation)
